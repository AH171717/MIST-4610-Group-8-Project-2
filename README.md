# Dataset Description

Our [dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/youth-tobacco-survey-yts-data) encompasses data from the Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS), focusing on tobacco use among youth across various U.S. states, spanning from 1999 to 2017. This dataset, accessible via the U.S. Government's Data.gov portal, has been cleaned to streamline the analysis process. It comprises 10,600 entries and includes key attributes such as the year of data collection, state identifiers, descriptions of tobacco-related behaviors, and demographic information, including gender and educational level of respondents. There are 31 total attributes.

The fields of the dataset detail the specific aspects of tobacco use being surveyed, such as "Cigarette Use (Youth)" or "Smokeless Tobacco Use (Youth)," along with responses categorized into types like "Ever" or "Frequent." The dataset includes robust sample sizes that indicate the scale of data collection for each point. With the dimensions available, we can analyze the correlation between demographic factors, geographical locations, and the prevalence of attitudes toward tobacco use among the youth. This facilitates a multifaceted analysis of trends over time and provides critical insights into effective public health strategies and educational efforts.

# Questions

## Question 1: Which states had the highest number of high school students who have tried tobacco products from 1999 to 2017?

The geospatial data visualization provided highlights the four U.S. states with the highest number of high school students who tried tobacco products from 1999 to 2017, which is crucial for identifying areas where public health interventions are most needed. This analysis is essential for understanding the effectiveness of tobacco control policies, comparing state-level data, and addressing the broader economic and public health implications of youth tobacco use. By exploring factors contributing to high usage rates, such as socioeconomic conditions and local regulations, and analyzing their long-term health impacts, stakeholders can develop targeted strategies to reduce smoking rates among adolescents, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

## Question 2: In those four states with the highest amount of Tobacco using students, how does cigarette use differ by gender and over time? 

The data visualization showing trends in cigarette use among high school students across four states over a decade invites questions about the changes in smoking rates and their correlation with gender. Investigating these trends is vital for assessing the impact of public health interventions and smoking prevention strategies targeted at young populations. By examining these patterns, stakeholders can identify whether male or female students are more responsive to such measures, providing insights that could tailor future efforts more effectively to each group.

Moreover, understanding the dynamics of teenage smoking in these states has significant social and economic implications. Reducing smoking rates among adolescents can lead to lower healthcare costs and improved quality of life in the long run. This analysis also highlights the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation of health policies to address the evolving landscape of youth smoking, ensuring that interventions remain effective against the backdrop of changing social norms and tobacco industry tactics. This comprehensive approach supports not just immediate public health goals but also broader societal benefits by fostering a healthier future generation.
