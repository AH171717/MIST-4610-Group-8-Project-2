# Dataset Description

Our [dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/youth-tobacco-survey-yts-data) encompasses data from the Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS), focusing on tobacco use among youth across various U.S. states, spanning from 1999 to 2017. This dataset, accessible via the U.S. Government's Data.gov portal, has been cleaned to streamline the analysis process. It comprises 10,600 entries and includes key attributes such as the year of data collection, state identifiers, descriptions of tobacco-related behaviors, and demographic information, including gender and educational level of respondents. There are 31 total attributes.

The fields of the dataset detail the specific aspects of tobacco use being surveyed, such as "Cigarette Use (Youth)" or "Smokeless Tobacco Use (Youth)," along with responses categorized into types like "Ever" or "Frequent." The dataset includes robust sample sizes that indicate the scale of data collection for each point. With the dimensions available, we can analyze the correlation between demographic factors, geographical locations, and the prevalence of attitudes toward tobacco use among the youth. This facilitates a multifaceted analysis of trends over time and provides critical insights into effective public health strategies and educational efforts.
